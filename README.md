# Password-Generator

## Description

In this project, I created a random password generator using Javascript. 

## Getting Started

The password generator page begins with a series of confirmations, and the users should click Generate Password link to be able to generate a random password that have symbols, numbers, uppercase, and lowercase letters. 

First, the users are provided with a prompt and asked to determine the length of their secure password. Once they enter this information in numeric value, they will need to confirm other criteria for their secure password.

Then, users are asked to confirm whether they want symbols, strings, and/or numbers in their passwords. For each criteria they confirm, the password will include those items as well.

Finally, a secure password is generated with user-determined criteria.
